## 3. What was used?

I wanted to create this website using pure JS, CSS and HTML. I wanted to write a code for all interactive elements (such as navbar, dropdown, slider) by myself and not to rely on any additional plugins. Website was coded using RWD techniques. I started coding view for desktop first and then mobile view.

### Tech stack:
* npm
  * parcel bundler
  * babel polyfill
  * autoprefixer
  * postcss-custom-properties
* HTML
* JS
* CSS
